My Conky setup. It's running on Ubuntu 18.04 lTS (Bionic Beaver) (`cat /etc/*-release`). 

## setup

1. `mkdir ~/.conky`
2. `touch ~/.conky/conkyrc`
3. `ln ~/.conky/conkyrc ~/.conkyrc`

## files

Main conky configuration file is `~/.conkyrc`. Supporting files and scripts are in `~/.conky`. Scripts need to be executable with `chmod +x script.sh`.
